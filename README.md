# Fungal Habitat Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to classify fungal habitats based on family, genus, and location data using machine learning techniques. We employed Random Forest and LightGBM classifiers with hyperparameter tuning and evaluated performance using multiple metrics.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset (`occurrences.csv`).
- **src/**: Holds the main code file (`fungal_habitat_prediction.py`).
- **images/**: Stores output images generated by the script, including visualizations of class distributions, feature importances, and model evaluation plots.

## Instructions

1. **Dataset**
   - Place the dataset (`occurrences.csv`) in the `data/` folder. Ensure the file path in the code matches this location.

2. **Dependencies**
   - Install the necessary Python libraries. You can do this by running:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn lightgbm matplotlib seaborn
     ```

3. **Running the Code**
   - Navigate to the `src/` folder and run the `fungal_habitat_prediction.py` script:
     ```bash
     python fungal_habitat_prediction.py
     ```
   - This script will perform the following tasks:
     - Load and preprocess the data
     - Train and optimize Random Forest and LightGBM models
     - Generate visualizations for habitat distributions, feature importances, confusion matrices, and ROC curves
     - Save the output visualizations in the `images/` folder

## Results
The project generates several visualizations to analyze the model's performance and feature importances:

- **Top Habitat Classes Distribution**: `images/habitat_distribution.png`
- **Feature Importances**: `images/feature_importance_rf.png` (Random Forest) and `images/feature_importance_lgbm.png` (LightGBM)
- **Confusion Matrix**: `images/confusion_matrix_rf.png`
- **Cross-Validation Accuracy**: `images/cv_accuracy.png`
- **ROC Curve**: `images/roc_curve.png`

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned and encoded categorical data.
   - Standardized numeric features for consistency.
  
2. **Model Training and Tuning**:
   - Implemented hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and LightGBM models.
   - Used cross-validation to evaluate model accuracy.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Analyzed accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores, and AUC scores.
   - Plotted and saved evaluation metrics for further analysis.

## File Descriptions
- **fungal_habitat_prediction.py**: Main Python script for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **data/occurrences.csv**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **images/**: Folder containing output plots and visualizations.
